# AIAgent-smol
smolagents is a library that focuses on codeAgent, a kind of agent that performs “Actions” through code blocks, and then “Observes” results by executing the code

The code imports various Python libraries, including:

smolagents – For creating AI agents.
datetime, pytz – For handling date and time in different time zones.
requests – Likely used for making API calls (though not used in this snippet).
yaml – For reading configuration from a YAML file.
Gradio_UI – A module that provides a user interface for interaction.

HfApiModel – Initializes an AI model from Hugging Face (Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct).
- max_tokens=2096: Controls the length of generated responses.
- temperature=0.5: Balances randomness (higher = more creative, lower = more deterministic).
